# Commit and Push Changes

1. Stage all changes:
```bash
git add -A
```

2. Commit with a descriptive message:
```bash
git commit -m "<descriptive message>"
```

3. Push to remote:
```bash
git push
```

## Notes
- Remote is `origin` → `https://github.com/LordZordack/project-tincture.git`
- Branch is `main`
- Always use descriptive commit messages summarizing what changed.
