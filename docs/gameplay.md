# Gameplay

## Core Loop
Apolest enters the dungeon completely naked — the Skia magic burns away all clothing on entry. He progresses through a series of rooms, defeating enemies and scavenging items. The goal is to find **Anaxarkas**, the last human king, imprisoned deep within the dungeon and impaled by a soul-binding sword. Pulling the sword free ends the game.

## Items & Carrying
All items in the world can be picked up, provided the player can handle the item's weight class. This includes weapons, armor, furniture, corpses, scenery — anything is fair game. The player can hold a maximum of **3 items** at a time: the active item floats in front of them, while the other 2 orbit around them. Movement speed is reduced proportionally to total carried weight. Light items can also be thrown. See [Items](items.md) for full details.

## Camera
The camera follows the player, zooming out to show more of the room as the player collects more items.

## Progression
The player starts with no items, but can collect items that can be used to upgrade their character. The player can also collect keys that can be used to open doors to new rooms.
