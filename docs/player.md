# Player

## Background

**Apolest Opsis** is haunted by the spirits of his two dead brothers: **Enas Opsis** and **Dyo Opsis**. Because of this haunting, he is invested with **Skia Aphalescence** (i.e. black magic), which allows him to enter the dungeon. Their presence is both a curse and a source of power — the brothers orbit around him as spectral companions.

A Magus named **Pelagios** tasks Apolest with delving into a dungeon saturated with **Skia** (black) magic. The dungeon is lethal to the uninitiated: anyone not invested with **Skia Aphalescence** is disintegrated into ash upon entry. Even with the protection, walking through the threshold burns away all clothing and equipment — Apolest enters the dungeon with nothing and must scavenge everything from within.

Deep inside the dungeon, the last human king, **Anaxarkas**, is imprisoned — impaled with a sword that binds his soul. When Apolest pulls the sword free, Anaxarkas' soul is released and possesses Apolest's body, ripping Apolest's own soul — along with the two brothers who haunt him — into the void.

## Mechanics

### Movement & Orientation
- Moves with **WASD**
- Orientation follows the **mouse cursor**
- **Space** to dash (short invincibility burst)
- Moves more quickly in direction player is oriented. Rotating the player's orientation by a large degree has a small delay, mimicing the delay of a real person turning. 

### Actions
- **Melee**: Attack with active held item (melee swing, ranged shot, or improvised weapon)
- **Projectile**: Throw active held item item
- **Block**: Block with active held item
- **Consume**: Consume active held item
- **Swap**: Swap active held item with one of the orbiting items

### Equipment
- Can equip items to **4 slots**: head, body, legs, and accessory
- Equipping an item replaces any item currently in that slot (old item drops)
- Some items may have special properties when equipped
- A menu can be opened

### Carrying
- Can hold up to **3 items** at a time
  - The **active item** floats in front of Apolest and is used for attacks
  - The other **2 items** orbit around him. Each of the brothers hold one of these items. The brothers will automatically block or attack with these items when the player is blocking or attacking. The player can swap between which item he is holding. 
- Can pick up any item in the world, provided he can handle the weight class
- Enters the dungeon **completely naked** — all gear must be found inside

### Health & Damage
- Has a health pool that depletes when taking damage from enemies or hazards
- Can heal through consumable items found in the dungeon

## The Brothers

**Enas Opsis** and **Dyo Opsis** orbit Apolest as spectral haunts. Their connection to him is severed when Anaxarkas claims his body at the end of the game.

The brothers are only seen as a faint glow around the two items that orbit player.
